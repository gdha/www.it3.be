<strong>When is it 72 hours later?</strong>

Sometimes we have to calculate when it is 72 hours from now for change related execution. It was always guessing before, but with the following we can easily calculate it with the `date` command:

    date -d "10:00 today + 72 hours"
    Fri Jun 12 10:00:00 CEST 2020
