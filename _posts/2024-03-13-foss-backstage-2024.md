<strong>FOSS Backstage 2024 - Why is there no new release? Nobody pays for the basics</strong>

We, Schlomo and myself, were lucky and had the chance to present on FOSS Backstage 2024 (March, 4th, 2024, Berlin) a talk around Relax-and-Recover eco-system and how hard it is to earn money with it.<br>
First of all some nice pictures were made during the talk by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/newthinking_de/albums/72177720315240717/">FOSS Backstage photographer Jan Michalko (flickr pages)</a>.
