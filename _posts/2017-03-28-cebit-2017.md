<strong>Relax-and-Recover Automated Testing at Open Source Forum (CeBIT 2017)</strong>

We were lucky to have the chance to be present and give a talk "Relax-and-Recover Automated Testing" for the CeBIT visitors [1].

The slides of the presentation are available at Slideshare:

Relax-and-Recover Automated Testing is an Open Source Project hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing) with a GPL v3 license, but it is important to understand that the development is only done for customers with a valid [ReaR Support Contract](http://www.it3.be/rear-support/index.html).
If you wonder - why? We have put so many energy into ReaR (mostly for free), but customers with a ReaR Software Support Contract may expect some additional added value, and as such we provide some additional quality testing. We do this via this project "Relax-and-Recover Automated Testing". As such we can increase:

 - ReaR Snapshot stability
 - Detect errors much faster (at least for what the customer uses in practice)
 - Bug fixes can be tested quite easily (for the customer)
 - GNU/Linux minor version updates can be tested with the same ReaR version
