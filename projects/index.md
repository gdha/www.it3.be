# IT3 Consultants Projects

What kind of projects are we involved in? In short for customer who pay for it and open source projects. It is clear that on projects done for customers we cannot communicate much without their approval.

On the following Open Source projects we can give more details.

## Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)

[Relax-and-Recover]({{ site.url }}/projects/rear/) is an open source Disaster Recovery tool handling bare metal restores in an automated way (as much as possible). Making snapshots of your system can be done *on-line* and send over to remote storage such as NAS, CIFS, USB, Network,...

## Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Automated Testing

[Relax-and-Recover Automated Testing]({{ site.url }}/projects/rear-automated-testing/) is an open source sub-project of ReaR dedicated to ReaR testing fully automated. This project is sponsored by customers who subscribed to one of our [ReaR Support Services]({{ site.url }}/rear-support/).

## Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) User Guide Documentation

[Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) User Guide Documentation]({{ site.url }}/projects/rear-user-guide/) is an open source sub-project of ReaR dedicated to provide a decent ReaR User Guide for the community. A [ReaR Subscription]({{ site.url }}/projects/rear-user-guide/) buys you guaranteed time per week that we will work on the User Guide.

## Upgrade-UX

[Upgrade-UX]({{ site.url }}/projects/upgrade-ux/) is an Open Source framework designed to assist the UNIX system engineer in patching or upgrading systems in a consistent and repeatable way with evidence before and after the running upgrade-ux.


## Config To HTML (cfg2html)

[Cfg2html]({{ site.url }}/projects/cfg2html/) is a little utility to collect the necessary system configuration files and system set-up to an ASCII file and HTML file. Simple to use and very helpful in disaster recovery situations.


## Ad-hoc Copy and Run (adhocr)

[adhocr]({{ site.url }}/projects/adhocr/) is a little `expect` utility to parallelize execution of commands on lots of systems.

## Wbemextras

[wbemextras]({{ site.url }}/projects/wbemextras/) contains some scripts to assist in HP SIM installation and configuration on HP-UX, but is in the meantime a retired project.

## Make CD-ROM Recovery (mkcdrec)

[mkCDrec]({{ site.url }}/projects/mkcdrec/) is the predecessor project of ReaR and has been phased out in favour of [ReaR]({{ site.url }}/projects/rear/). mkCDrec is a retired project, but getting support is still possible, however no longer free of charge.
