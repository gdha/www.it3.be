# Senior Unix System Administration

If you have been looking for permanent employees for a while, then you know that Unix System Administrators looking for new job opportunities are seldom right now. On the contrary, current System Administrators are looking for none sysadmin jobs. You have projects to be completed, but your staff is already so busy that your backlog is getting huge! We can help!

If you need someone to work with you for 3-6 months, we can help you run your computing environment on a day-to-day basis, too. Convenient flat monthly rates available for contracts longer than 4 months.
